# CVD-Model
## Dataset Description

This dataset contains information on 319,000 patients across 18 features, focusing on heart disease exploratory data analysis. The dataset provides various health-related attributes that help in identifying patterns and risk factors for heart disease.

### Features:

1. **HeartDisease**: Target trait (presence or absence of heart disease).
2. **BMI**: Body Mass Index, used to assess the degree of correspondence between a person's mass and height, indicating whether their mass is insufficient, normal, or excessive.
3. **Smoking**: A major risk factor for cardiovascular diseases, affecting heart rate, blood pressure, and clotting tendencies.
4. **AlcoholDrinking**: Effects of alcohol consumption on heart health, including heart pain and permanent disturbances in functioning.
5. **Stroke**: History of ischemic or hemorrhagic stroke, linked to heart disease and disrupted blood flow to the brain.
6. **PhysicalHealth**: Number of days in the past month when physical health was reported as poor.
7. **MentalHealth**: Number of days in the past month when mental health was reported as poor.
8. **DiffWalking**: Difficulty in climbing stairs, indicating physical limitations.
9. **Sex**: Gender of the individual.
10. **AgeCategory**: Age category of the subjects.
11. **Race**: Racial background of the individual.
12. **Diabetic**: Whether the individual has diabetes.
13. **PhysicalActivity**: Whether the individual engaged in physical activity or exercise during the past 30 days, excluding their regular job.
14. **GenHealth**: Overall self-reported well-being.
15. **SleepTime**: Number of hours of sleep per day.
16. **Asthma**: Whether the individual has asthma.
17. **KidneyDisease**: Whether the individual has kidney disease.
18. **Skin Cancer**: Whether the individual has skin cancer.

### Objective:
The goal is to analyze the features and their relationships to heart disease, to develop a model for predicting heart disease risk.
